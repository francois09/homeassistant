This repository contains for now only blueprints for managing heater system

## Principle

1. Each room is autonomous, and have helpers for their properties
2. Each room should have a climate valve, and a T째 sensor

## How it works

Based on triggers, each room will compute the T째 setpoint, and if necessary activate a helper
saying it needs heating.

Another automation (not included here for now), will decide to start or stop the heating system
if rooms need it or no.

### Heater request compute

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and show the blueprint import dialog with a specific blueprint pre-filled.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/blueprint_import.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/blueprint_import/?blueprint_url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Ffrancois09%2Fhomeassistant%2Fmain%2Fblueprints%2Fheater_request_compute.yaml)

This blueprint compute the boolean (switch) helper of the room, based on Climate valve setpoint, and room T째. If heating is requested, it aslo fake the local_temperature_calibration to ensure valve is correctly opened. In my case, T째 sensor is far from Climate, and close to my preffered location in the room.

### Heater setpoint compute

This blueprint compute the correct setpoint based on the room schedule and the potential manual setting, to determine and send it to the Climate valve.

### Heater switch mode

This blueprint take into account a manual change on the Climate valve, or the Auto setting to modify setpoint.
